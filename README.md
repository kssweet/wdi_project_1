Know-Your-World
=============
NEWS AGGREGATOR: "Know Your World"


DEPLOYED HERE!: http://know-your-world.herokuapp.com



Working Version:

Conceived for use for individuals wanting to delve into current events and have an immediate background for the articles he/she is reading.

World sections, articles, and abstracts pull from multiple resources from top articles from the NYTimes WorldNews API.

User presented with top articles of the day along with abstracts.

Choices to link to article via NYTimes.com, hoping to change that to a pop up window on the Know Your World site.



Coming Soon:

User can click a link "See related articles" to display a list of related topics - here the link will pull search quearies from the original world news api hash.

A logged-in reader can like and unlike articles - which essentially saves and deletes them for later use. But a reader would be able to see list of most liked articles.
